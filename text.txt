Simply put we stand in my view at an inflection point in history.What else did Biden sayMr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.The US he said is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges even if we have intense disagreements in other areas.The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for a Cold War that would be different from the past one and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage.The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad saying the US was ending a period of relentless war for a new era of relentless diplomacy.Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to .bn .bn by .

French foreign minister JeanYves Le Drian described the agreement as a stab in the back and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled.The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid vaccines and nonreciprocal travel restrictions as well as frugality with climate aid.
